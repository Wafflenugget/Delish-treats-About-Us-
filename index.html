        <h2>Our Story: How It All Began</h2>
        <p class="date">Published: December 24, 2024</p>
        <p>Every great idea begins with a spark, and for us, that spark was the pure joy of seeing our own dogs light up over the simplest things—a walk, a pat on the head, or a tasty treat. Delish Treats started in our kitchen, where we began experimenting with recipes that were as wholesome as they were delicious. We wanted to give our pets something that wasn’t just good for them but also brought a smile to their furry faces.</p>
        <p>What started as a small project for friends and family quickly grew. People loved the idea of handmade, heart-filled treats, and soon we realized we could share this joy with more people—and pets—around the world. It’s been a journey of love, learning, and lots of wagging tails!</p>

        <h2>Our Mission: Spreading Joy, One Treat at a Time</h2>
        <p class="date">Published: December 24, 2024</p>
        <p>At Delish Treats, we believe every pet deserves to feel special. Our mission isn’t just about creating great products; it’s about fostering moments of joy between pets and their humans. Whether it’s a playful afternoon in the park or a cozy evening on the couch, we want our treats to be part of the memories you create with your furry friends.</p>
        <p>We also care deeply about doing things the right way. That means using natural ingredients, supporting sustainable practices, and giving back to our community. Through partnerships with local shelters and animal charities, we aim to spread love and kindness to pets who need it most. Because at the heart of Delish Treats, it’s all about connection, compassion, and happiness.</p>
